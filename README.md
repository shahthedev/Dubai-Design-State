- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Heroicons (React)
- react-hot-toast

    ProfileForm.jsx   # Responsive form + validation + image upload + toast
    Sidebar.jsx   # Responsive form + validation + image upload + toast
  App.jsx

```

## ‚úÖ Requirements Covered
- Mobile-first, responsive two-column desktop layout
- Semantic labels and inputs, accessible names
- Client-side validation (required + email format)
- Mocked image upload with preview (no backend)
- Save button triggers success toast
- Pixel-aligned paddings, colors, radii to the mockups

## üìù Notes
- Colors use Tailwind defaults plus a custom `brand.blue` that matches the mockup Save button.

- No persistence by design; this demo focuses on UI/UX and validation.
